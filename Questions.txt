Explain what the ".map" properties of arrays does.

    ".map" creates an array from calling a specific function on each item in the parent array. It is a non-mutating method that creates a new array, as opposed to mutating methods, which only make changes to the calling array.


Explain what the ".reduce" properties of arrays does.

     The .reduce method executes a user-supplied “reducer” callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. 

How is ".map" different from reduce?

    Both methods can reach the same result, but .map can be a shorter and much cleaner. 

What are "switch" statements?

    Switch statements are used to preform different actions based on different conditions.
